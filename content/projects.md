This is a list of my current projects that I'm involved in one way or another.

## Proxmox VE Server

This very website runs on a Proxmox VE server maintained in my home. If you're curious, the specifications are below:

+ Dell Poweredge R430
+ 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2640 V4
+ 192GB DDR4-2133
+ 240GB RAID1
+ 1.2TB RAID1
+ 12TB SINGLE DRIVE
+ 8 x 1G NIC

This is the server that I use for homelabbing purposes, doing everything from running my network with OPNsense to miscellaneous Docker and LXC containers.

## WiiLink

I am a contributor at WiiLink, helping with community management for [its Discord server](https://discord.gg/wiilink) as well as some other things in the background. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.wiilink24.com/).

## wii.hacks.guide

I am a main contributor for [wii.hacks.guide](https://wii.hacks.guide/), the top destination for Wii hacking and homebrew guides. If you've ever tried to hack your Wii using this site, you may have used a guide I wrote! The GitHub page is [here](https://github.com/hacks-guide/Guide_Wii/) if you're curious about the source.
