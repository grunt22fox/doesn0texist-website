      <description>High school sucked, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about a time where I was able to use a Chromebook to slack off in ways that most students could only dream of.&#xA;Like I said above, high school sucked ass in many, many, many, many, many ways. This was an alarming amount of ass suckage - I was bored out of my mind most days attempting to stay awake while I was in a place for a third of a full day sitting in on things that I had little to no interest in learning.</description>

      <description>For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to make my own blog and website but was never able to get the motivation to sit down and do it. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a reality.&#xA;I just want to thank you for dropping by my blog and taking the time to at least skim by my posts - I appreciate the fact that someone else would read this stuff more than you can imagine. I am going to make posts about technology, video games, life, and anything else I can come by, and I hope you&amp;rsquo;re around to enjoy the ride.</description>
